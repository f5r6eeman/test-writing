# test-writing
Seeing how writing works

The word `class` is a C# keyword.
This is a snippet of C# code.
```
using static System.Console;

namespace Freeman
{
    static class Program
    {
        static void Main( )
        {
            WriteLine( "Hello World!" );
        }
    }
}
```
This is discussion, blah, blah, blah.

this is a new paragraph, maybe talking about `class Program` or the `Main( )` method or a keyword such as `using`.
